ASSIGNMENT: 
Use the “session_7_dataset.xlsx” for this assignment. 

You will find data from several properties in Madrid as well as some historical and sociodemographic data.

1. Analyze this dataset to estimate property prices as a regression problem. Use algorithms seen so far in class and perform exploratory daya analysis (EDA) to determine how you will proceed.
2. Analyze data and redefine the problem to create a classification one.Use the following algorithms and analyze results:
 • Perceptron Learning Algorithm
 • Logistic Regression
 • Generative Models (LDA, QDA)
 • KNN3

Extra - use other methods you may know and compare results with the previous ones.
